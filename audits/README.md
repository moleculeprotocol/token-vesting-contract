# Security audits

## April 2023

### [Audit by Pashov](2023-04-pashov.md). 
- You can also find the report in his Github: [https://github.com/pashov/audits/blob/master/solo/MoleculeVesting-security-review.md](https://github.com/pashov/audits/blob/master/solo/pdf/MoleculeVesting-security-review.pdf)
- The contracts were audited at the commit [88c1cda0e77d881fffb8a9deab1f65585503d504](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/token-vesting-contract/tree/88c1cda0e77d881fffb8a9deab1f65585503d504)
- Most of the findings were then fixed (and marked as fixed in the audit report) and reviewed by Pashov again at this [commit](https://github.com/moleculeprotocol/token-vesting-contract/commit/8f8f786d95ee8db1e3d3ae96e26a86b7e250de0f)
